RISKS:

1. User explosion -> increase processing power or number of machines (scale up & out)
2. Android API changes -> update the app as soon as possible, inform the users that the app is currently in maintenance or down.
3. Third-party OAuth API changes -> update the app as soon as possible, the same strategy as the previous risk.
4. Stores are refusing to make a partnership -> ??
